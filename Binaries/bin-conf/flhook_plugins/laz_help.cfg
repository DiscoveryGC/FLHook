Start = <PARA/><TEXT>Welcome to the Discovery mod and multiplayer community!</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The best way to learn is from other players, so feel free to ask experienced people or join a faction to team up and make friends. To learn about the benefits of role-play type /helproleplay. You can enter a non-role-play system to train combat or find helpful players by typing /conn while docked with empty cargo hold (/return brings you back to the role-play universe).</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Before you set off to explore the mysteries hidden in the Sirius sector, fight the "good" fight, become a notorious pirate, or morph into a blue alien, we recommend you get a decent ship. The necessary credits can be earned by taking missions in bars, trading, smuggling, mining, or working for players as hired guns.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Credits can be transferred between ships using plugin commands (type /helpcash). The /restart command lets you restart your ship as a certain faction or specialization (type /showrestarts to see available restart options). What gear you can buy and use efficiently depends on your reputation, ship, and ID (type /helprep for info).</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>We ask you to please choose a name that allows for immersion into the Freelancer universe. Don't use l33tspeak, memes, or imports from universes like Starwars or Startrek. If you don't want to recreate your ship from scratch to rename, use the /renameme command.</TEXT><PARA/>
Chat = <PARA/><TEXT>Default is local chat (blue text), which is seen by players within your radar range. Local chat isn't visible when docked. The following command shortcuts before messages over-ride what you have selected in the player list (group, individual player, or system chat):</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>/s - System (light blue) seen by all players in the system</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/t - Private Message (green) the player you are targeting</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/r - PM (green) the player that last sent you a PM</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/pm name - Send PM or mail if the player is offline</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/mail - Read your mail. /maildel empties your inbox.</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/g - Group chat (pink)</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/fm tag - Send (gold) message to everyone with "tag" in name</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/l - Local chat</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/set chatfont - Set the font for chat messages</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/invite name - Invite a player into a chat/missions group</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/fi tag - Invite everyone who has "tag" in name</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/join - Accept a group invitation</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/leave - Leave your group (also fixes mission bug)</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/marktarget - Assign your target to the entire group</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/ignore name - Ignore any messages from "name" </TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/ignored - Lists ignored players</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/delignore - Clear ignore list</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/[1-9] - Send a preset message (can be combined as /l[1-9], /g[1-9], t[1-9]) </TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/setmsg - Save a preset message</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>/showmsgs - Shows your preset messages</TEXT><PARA/>
RP = <PARA/><TEXT>Role playing enhances the game experience by creating a more immersive universe, and allows players to contribute through their creativity, to entertain and be entertained beyond combat and "material progression" game aspects.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>To role play means you talk and behave like a fictional character of your own making, with his or her own name and biography. Your character's personality and motivations can be largely different from your own. Be a hero, an anti-hero, a villain, a leader, a disciple, a back-stabbing crook, a gung-ho soldier, a serial killer, an artificial intelligence, a money-groping capitalist, a weirdo from outer space, multi-facetted and complex, or simple-minded. If you want to role-play personalities similar to Han Solo, Jean-Luc Piccard, or Casper Orillion, please do but use different names for them and their ships.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Role-playing is done with words as well as weapons. Be tolerant of the fact that other players may enjoy either the story-telling or the space combat aspects of the game more than you do. If you like to talk and don't like being shot at, it's up to your common sense to avoid situations in which you're destined to explode. If you like shooting and being shot at, it's up to your common sense to respect the required role play context, as well as the server rules. Space is both fascinating and dangerous.</TEXT><PARA/>
Trade = <PARA/><TEXT>Trading is an efficient and straight-forward method to increase your wealth, and can be rather laid-back at times (or as some say: boring).</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Most players have one or more trade ships to make credits and transfer them to their other ships (/helpcash for info).</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Ships with larger holds bring larger profits, but have less maneuverability (require more skill to dock with lanes) and more vulnerability to pirates. </TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Hire armed escorts to protect yourself against the parasites, and if they still manage to deprive you of your hard earned credits or cargo, quench your thirst for revenge by putting up a bounty on their heads (Bounty Boards on discoverygc.com).</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>At times, running like hell, sweet-talking yourself out of a stick-up, or simply paying the pirate are the cheaper alternatives. </TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Attempting to warp out of this dimension by disconnecting from the server to escape piracy is never the cheaper alternative, because it angers the gods who see everything you do, and they will punish you for it, severely. </TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The more laid-back trade runs are a great time to chat with potential business partners, read the /help pages, or use LEFT-TAB + RETURN to go in and out of windowed mode to visit discoverygc.com on the side (works best if you set a resolution lower than your desktop resolution in the game launcher).</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Explore and dock on new stations to discover new trade routes, or use "/restart Trader" to get a nav map with some good trader routes. If your character has a natural propensity towards the informal sector, use "/restart smuggler".</TEXT><PARA/>
Mine = <PARA/><TEXT>When using mining lasers to shoot moving rocks within minable areas, mineral ore will transfer to your or your mining-partner's cargo hold. Minable areas are marked yellow when the appropriate symbol is selected in the nav map.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Gas is mined by shooting the moving particles in the exhaust of stationary gas mining facilities.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Using mining lasers, a mining ship, and mining ID will boost your efficiency and generate ore faster. If you target another player ship within 1k range while mining, the ore is automatically transferred to that ship's cargo hold (unless your IDs are incompatible).</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Working as a miner/hauler team, with one mining ship and one transport, can earn you credits very efficiently.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Mining efficiency also depends on the individual ID and field characteristics. Check discoverygc.com for more info.</TEXT><PARA/>Â 
Cash = <PARA/><TEXT>/givecash shipname amount [anon] - Transfers credits to one of your other ships or to another player's ship. The beneficiary doesn't need to be online at the time of the transfer. If you write anon at the end, it will not tell the target ship where the cash came from.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>/drawcash name cashcode amount - Draws cash from another ship using a cashcode.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>/showcash name cashcode - Shows how much cash is currently in the specified ship.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>/set cashcode - Sets the cashcode so you (or other players) can draw cash from your current ship.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>/givecasht money [anon] - Transfers credits to the target ship. If you write anon at the end, it will not tell the target ship where the cash came from.</TEXT><PARA/>
Rep = <PARA/><TEXT>Your reputation with NPC factions determines whether NPCs attack or ignore you, what color their faction shows up as (green, white, red), your own IFF (Identify Friend-Foe tag other players see when targeting your ship), if bases let your dock, whether bar characters will talk to you or not, and what equipment you can or can't buy.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>View your reps with NPC factions by pressing the F8 key or clicking the symbol that looks like a man on the top right of your HUD. Killing NPCs (not players) from a faction will lower your rep, while fulfilling missions for the faction will raise it. Being grouped with players who accomplish missions will improve your rep even if you don't actively partake. Raising your rep with one faction will slightly raise your rep with its allies and lower your rep with its enemies. Bribe bar characters to quickly improve your rep if they are willing to talk to you and you can afford it.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>A minimum friendly rep is required to join a faction by buying its ID or to buy their equipment. Mounting an ID will force the rep of the faction's enemies or allies to a minimum hostile/friendly levels. You will automatically take on a faction's IFF if you are friendliest to them. A faction will start flashing yellow in the rep list and other people will see your ship as affiliated with it when you have their IFF. To get rid of your current IFF by losing rep, type /droprep.</TEXT><PARA/>
Power = <PARA/><TEXT>When you buy equipment or ships that don't match your ID, your power core will lose efficiency. This is done to uphold variety and realism, so pirates don't fly the same ship setups as the police. Check the Tech Chart at discoverygc.com to find out working combinations without having to buy the item first.</TEXT><PARA/>
Combat = <PARA/><TEXT>There are many ways to improve your ship's combat capabilities by buying better armor, weaponry, shields, thrusters, or by choosing another ship altogether. However, skill, tactics, and understanding of combat mechanics are the most important assets in a fight. The best equipped battleship whose captain has poor understanding of tactics will be helpless against smaller craft which are too agile to hit and too fast to pursue or escape from. Fighting against players is very different from fighting against NPCs.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>It's therefore recommended to train combat early on to get a grasp of tactics and mechanics, especially using small agile craft. This is best done by joining player factions who are motivated to train you as a competent wingman.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Being able to dodge enemy fire by using thruster (TAB key on default keyboard setups) and strafe (A and D keys on default setup) and randomly changing direction is the most important tactic for survival. Learning to quick-dock on lanes and gates (fly up very close to the correct location before pressing F3 to dock) will save you from many deaths in prolonged docking sequences.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The cruise disruptor can keep the enemy from escaping, but also detonates their mines, torpedoes, and missiles near their own ships. Not the pilot who has the biggest guns wins, but the pilot who knows how to avoid receiving damage. Splitting weapons into weapons groups (number keys, customizable in the controls menu) can optimize your energy efficiency against enemy shields or hull.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Taking into account projectile speeds will improve your aim. Building skill requires practice, and there are many more tricks that experienced players will be willing to teach you if you work with them.</TEXT><PARA/>
