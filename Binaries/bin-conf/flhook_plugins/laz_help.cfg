help = restarts, Restarts, <TEXT>When you make a new character, they will appear in a Stargazer and will have a few thousand credits onboard. This is the default for all new characters and can be hardcore working your way with such few resources.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>That's where restart commands come into play. They are all within the scope of rules and can't be exploited. Restart commands allow your new character to begin in a desired place and faction, same ship but with a bit more money than before.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Type the '/showrestarts' command to see the list of accessible restarts.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>All restarts affect your reputation. When your reputation with a faction is below a certain number, (-0.55 or half of a square before going red) it means you cannot dock on this faction bases and will turn on you if their allied, but hostile to you, ships come into the vicinity. Reputation lower than that will trigger all said faction's NPCs and stations to attack your ship, possibly turning other neutral to you, but allied to them, factions against you.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Neutral factions allow you to dock and trade, but may not offer you the best of their equipment and/or ships. Commodities aren't normally affected by reputations. Allied reputation means this faction will sell it's best equipment to you, help you fight factions neutral to them, but hostile to you, and possibly offer you their ID, which you can mount on your ship to become affiliated with said allies. IDs change reputation just as restarts do, so be careful when mounting them.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Now that you know the risks, you might want to join some, say, a revolutionary group such as the Blood Dragons. Just type '/restart kudragon' and you are ready to fight for the better future of Kusari.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Want to lift the Coalition from its knees and crush capitalism once and for all? Type '/restart fccoalition'. Want to be neutral for everyone and just strive to live a peaceful life away from the colonies? Type '/restart fcZoner'. And so on.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Faction prefixes like 'ku', 'br', 'li', 'rh', and 'ga' tell you where you will appear after the restart. Factions without a clear zone of influence have the prefix 'fc' in front of them. Factions with the prefix 'Corp' in them mean they are a Corporation and will most likely involve lots of trading and mining.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Using this command will delete your current ship with all its equipment, stats such as time spent, etc and make a new one in a location depending on which command you input, unless you have a sum of credits above a certain minimum, and/or are of a too high rank. That means, even if you have empty pockets, you current equipment such as ship and weapons will have an impact on your net worth, and as such on your rank.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Command '/restart beginner' can be viewed as beginner package. You will restart in Liberty, the safest place in Sirius, Pennsylvania, with a freighter and a comfortable sum of credits for early trading.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Restarting as a Freelancer can be done in different ways:</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>'/restart freelancerbw' will generate your new character in Border Worlds, systems with little House control and lots of freedom, but almost lawless and often dangerous.</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>'/restart freelancerew' will make you ready to explore the fringes of known space (the Edge Worlds) almost immediately.

help = pob, Player Bases (PoBs), <TEXT>The prospect of making a player-owned based "Pob" , whether to store and sell ore, produce special equipment, or just as a roleplay asset, is on inviting idea for new and old players.  However, building, maintaining and upgrading a Pob can be a hefty investment of time and credits so you'll want to be prepared.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Disclaimer: It is recommended that you get familiar with the game, forums, and community, before attempting to build a PoB. This is because they are quite difficult to maintain and keep, and depending on where you construct one, you may attract the attention of the local factions which may intent to extort or destroy it. There is a detailed guide on the forums available, and it's recommended that you view that before proceeding with the construction of a base.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>First, consider getting some friends to help you- It may mean splitting the profits but it could be worth it for the long-term survival of your base. Next, consider location of your new base. Some things to keep in mind: </TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>- A base needs daily supplies to keep running. The main commodity is "Reinforced Alloy" but "Robotic Hardware" and "Hull Segments" may also be used. The base needs 8640 per day, to maintain its condition. Ideally, you'll want at least 1 base nearby thats sells one of these.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>-Additionally, the base will "crew" to run it and keep it in tip-top shape. Each core level of base will need 200 crew members to work, and each crew member consumes 1 unit of "Food Rations", "Oxygen" and "Water" every 10 hours. Any variety of "Food Rations" will work but you can also use "Synth Paste", "Kyushu Rice" and "Gaian Wildlife". Since you'll need less of these than the previous commodities, you can generally get away with the base being a bit further away.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>-See what factions have an interest in the areas you are considering. All house governments have some restrictions, and fees, that must be paid to allow your base to be built. Additionally, organized pirates and factions in the independent and edge worlds can make similar demands of your base, so don't think you'll be entirely left alone outside of house space either. </TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>With all that taken into mind, now you can get down to the business of actually making your base. You'll need a specific ship to do that, the "Base construction Platform" (BCP). You can buy one off a corporate base throughout Sirius, or another player. Next, you need to collect the resources to build the initial station core. You will need:</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>- 140 PlasFoam Conduits</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>- 140 Industrial Hardware</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>- 100 Reinforced Alloy</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>- 140 High Performance Alloy</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>- 50 Optronic Arrays</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>- 50 Heat Sinks</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>- 30 Fusion Diodes </TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Once you have gathered those, put them into the cargo hold of the BCP and fly it out to your bases to-be location. Once you enter the command to build the base, it will be spawned out 200 meters in front facing you, with 1% health. You should consider having a transport parked nearby, or flown by a friend, with the required 200 "Crew" 200, "Food Rations" 200, "Oxygen", 200"Water" and fill the rest of the cargo hold with with "Reinforced Alloy", or one of the other repair commodities listed above. Once that is ready, enter the command </TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>"/base deploy password basename" </TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Where 'password' is the administrator password to login and manage the base. Keep this secret to anyone you don't want to have full access and control over the base. And 'base name'  is the name under which the station will show up to others. At first, only your BCP will be allowed to dock, you will need to adjust adjust the docking rights for other ships to dock. From inside the base, you can use the "/base" command to manage your new installation. </TEXT><PARA/><PARA/>
help = ids, Discovery IDs, <TEXT>The Discovery universe is largely governed by equipment accessories known as IDs. All players must have no more than one type of ID mounted at any time. It is impossible to launch without one. These IDs occupy your ship's tractor beam equipment slot and change your beam's colour depending on what ID you mount. Most importantly, in the description notes of each of these IDs are rules that outline what you can and cannot do with that ID. The differences between each ID's parameters can vary, but all will outline your character's limitations with regard to:</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>-What actions are prohibited to you</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>-Any special combat and engagement rules</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>-What types of ships you are allowed to fly</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>-Where you are allowed to go, otherwise known as your 'ZoI' or Zone of Interest</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>A breach of any of these parameters is a direct violation of server rules.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>With each ID comes it's own reputation override. When an ID is mounted, your reputation with every faction will be automatically re-calibrated to match the political standing of the faction ID you have chosen. In addition your ship will be labelled with an NPC faction tag before your character name like other NPC ships in-game. It is important to be mindful that your reputation effects where you can fly safely and where you can land.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Generic IDs are more neutral than most and are quite relaxed in their roaming restrictions. This makes them ideal for you to explore the discovery universe and it's wide variety of factions. Therefore it is recommended that you mount a generic ID until you are familiar enough with a faction to join it. The following are generic IDs and can be found on most bases:</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Freelancer ID</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>Pirate ID</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>Miner ID</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>Recruit ID</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>For more information visit www.discoverygc.com/forums</TEXT><PARA/>

help = rp, Role-Playing and You!, <JUST loc="center"/><TEXT>What is 'RP'?</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><JUST loc="left"/><TEXT>Simply put: RP stands for Role Play, or Role Playing.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>When you RP, it means that you assume the role of a character. Imagine yourself as an actor in a play or movie. You pretend that you are someone else for the sake of the movie or play in order to entertain the audience, as well as provide a bit of fun for yourself. While acting, you may take on personality traits that differ from your own for the sake of playing true to a character.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Role Playing is much like acting in a movie or play! The key difference is that, while a movie may have a script, typical Role Playing includes a lot of improvisation. In this sense, Role Playing is also like writing a book, except that you are the author of your own character, while others are the authors of their own characters. When brought together, a fluid, ever-changing story unfolds in front of the players in the form of their characters interacting with one another.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>In a nutshell, Role Playing is a bunch of people pretending to be someone whom they are not in order to entertain themselves and others. In Discovery, Role Playing is mandatory by the rules, however there is no specific definition on what passes as Role Playing. Generally speaking, the easiest character to RP is one that shares personality traits with your real life self. Think about how you as a person would react to certain situations. Alternatively, what would you NOT do when faced with certain decisions?</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>One key thing to keep in mind when Role Playing is to separate what *you* as the player know, and what *your character* knows. Just because you know something juicy or interesting doesn't necessarily mean that your *character* knows the same information. For example, let's say that you see a character (Sam) on the Discovery forums in a story that reveals Sam to be a spy. You as the *player* know this, but unless your *character* is in that story, your character does *not* know that Sam is a spy. Attempting to act otherwise is considered 'meta-gaming', which is taking player knowledge and magically causing your character to have this knowledge, too.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>RP stands for Role Playing. When you Role Play, you pretend to be someone else, much like how actors in movies do. Unlike a movie with a script, Role Playing is usually improvised, and as such is fluid and ever-changing. You are the author of your own character, just as other players are the authors of their characters.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>When you play a character, think about how they would react to certain situations and the actions of other characters. Much like in a movie, remember: The villain and hero of a story can be best friends off-camera. Likewise, you may not particularly like someone as a person, but your character may consider their character a worthwhile ally.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>In Discovery, Role Playing is mandatory. However, *how much* effort you place into RP is completely up to you. From the casual actor to the pour-your-heart-out author - the choice is yours.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>So get your name out there, pilot. See where life takes you.

Try to avoid piling multiple ships on a lone fighter, for instance.</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>- Attacking ships with significantly higher classed vessels. Another thing that should be avoided is dropping capital ships on a snub fights. A well balanced fight doesn't require a capital ship to cruise in and start shooting the snubs.</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT>- Dodging for very long periods in a 1v1 (aka shieldrunning).

This tactic is extremely hard to defend against as the only option for someone in this situation is to use a cloak disrupter, which most people do not have.
