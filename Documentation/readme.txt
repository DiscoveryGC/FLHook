=============
version: 1.6.2 plugin

================================================================================
== INSTALLATION ================================================================
================================================================================
FLHOOK ONLY WORKS WITH FLSERVER 1.1. USING IT WITH 1.0 WILL CRASH FLSERVER!!!

copy the files from "bin" to your freelancer/exe directory and edit the FLHook.ini
in order to suite your needs.
then open dacomsrv.ini in "...\freelancer\exe" and append FLHook.dll to the 
   [Libraries] section. flserver will load flhook whenever you start it.
   
================================================================================
== PLUGIN INSTALLATION =========================================================
================================================================================
in a typical case plugins are distributed in an archive with a folder structure
that you just need to copy to the "Freelancer/EXE/" folder.
The plugin DLL needs to be in ".EXE/flhook_plugins/".
Please read any readme file that may be delivered with the plugin you want to
install!

================================================================================
== CONFIG ======================================================================
================================================================================
take a look at the comments in FLHook.ini

================================================================================
== ADMIN-COMMANDS ==============================================================
================================================================================
commands can be executed by administrators in several ways:
- using the FLHook console(-> access to all commands)
- ingame by typing .command in the chat(e.g. .getcash Player1)
  this will only work when you own the appropriate rights which may be set via
  the setadmin command. FLHook will store the rights of each player in his
  account-directory in flhookadmin.ini.
- via a socket connection in raw text mode(e.g. with putty)
  connect to the port given in the FLHook.ini and enter "PASS password". after
  having successfuly logged in you may enter all of the commands you want(as
  long as you have the neccessary rights). you may have several socket connections
  at the same time. exiting the connection may be done by entering "quit" or simply
  by closing it.

- CASH -
all cash functions work no matter if the player is currently logged in or not
getcash <charname>
  shows current account balance of <charname>
setcash <charname> <amount>
  sets current account balance of <charname> to <amount>
setcashsec <charname> <oldmoney> <amount>
  sets current account balance of <charname> to <amount>, only works when his old account balance is <oldmoney>
addcash <charname> <amount>
  adds <amount> to the current account balance of <charname>
addcashsec <charname> <oldmoney> <amount>
  adds <amount> to the current account balance of <charname>, only works when his old account balance is <oldmoney>

- KICK/BAN -
kick <charname> <reason>
  disconnects <charname>. the user will be displayed <reason>, if it is specified.
ban <charname>
  bans <charname>'s account
  <charname> stays connected if he's currently on the server
unban <charname>
  unbans <charname>'s account
kickban <charname> <reason>
  kicks and bans <charname> (2 in 1, same as kick <charname> <reason>, ban <charname>)

- MSG -
msg <charname> <text>
  private message <text> to <charname> (shown as "Console: <text>")
msgs <systemname> <text>
  send <text> to all players in <systemname> (shown as "Console: <text>")

  message <text> to the whole universe (shown as "Console: <text>")
fmsg <charname> <xmltext>
  private message <xmltext> to <charname> (see XMLTEXT section for further details)

  message <xmltext> to the whole universe (see XMLTEXT section for further details)

- BEAM/KILL -
beam <charname> <basename>
  force <charname> to land on <basename> (player must be in space)
  <basename> must be either the shortname(like Li01_01_Base for manhatten) or a shortcut defined in the FLHook.ini
kill <charname>
  kills <charname>

- REPUTATION -
resetrep <charname>
  sets <charname>'s reputations to the one specified in "mpnewcharacter.fl"
setrep <charname> <repgroup> <value>
  set <charname>'s reputation for <repgroup> to <value>. <value> should be between -1 and 1.
  example:
  "setrep playerxy li_n_grp 0.7"
  -> set playerxy's reputation for liberty navy to 0.7
setrep <charname> <repgroup>
  return the feelings of <repgroup> towards <charname>

- CARGO -
cargo commands only work when the targeted player is ingame
enumcargo <charname>
  lists <charname>'s cargo, first reply will be the remaining hold size
addcargo <charname> <good> <count> <mission>
  adds <count> numbers of <good>(shortname like co_gun01_mark02,commodity_silver,etc OR hash) to <charname>'s cargo
  if <mission> is set to 1, the cargo is declared as mission cargo
  note: see issues

writecharfile <charname> <data>
  writes <data> into <charname>'s userfile(xxx.fl). existing charfile will be overwritten. you should
  be careful with this one because a corrupted charfile may lead to server crashes and flhook does 
  not do any syntax checks on <data>.
  NOTE: YOU MUST REPLACE LINE-WRAPS WITH \n(TEXT)
  example:
  writecharfile playerxy [Player]\ndescription = 00300034002f0031003\n\n ... etc.

- MISC INFOS -
you can use client-ids instead of <charname> by appending $ to the cmd.
examples: 
getcash$ 12
kickban$ 1
etc.

you can also use "shortcuts" instead of the whole character-name for a currently logged in player by appending
& to the cmd. FLHook traverses all logged in players and checks if their character-name contains
<charname>(case insensitive) and if so, the command will operate on this player. an error will be shown if the 
searchstring given in <charname> is ambiguous.
examples (let's assume there are 2 players logged in: "superhax0r" and "..::[]SUPERNERD[]::.."):
"kick& nerd" kicks "..::[]SUPERNERD[]::.." because his nick contains "nerd"
"getcash& super" fails because there are multiple character names containing "super"

all commands return "OK" when successful or "ERR <errortext>" when error occured

================================================================================
== RIGHTS ======================================================================
================================================================================
rights may be seperated by a comma (e.g. setadmin playerxy cash,kickban,msg)
superadmin        -> everything
cash              -> cash commands
kickban           -> kick/ban commands
beamkill          -> beam/kill/resetrep/setrep command
msg               -> msg commands
cargo             -> cargo commands
characters        -> character editing/reading commands
reputation		  -> reputation commands
eventmode         -> eventmode (only when connected via socket)
settings		  -> rehash and reserved slots (setadmin only with superadmin rights)
plugins			  -> plugin commands
other	          -> all other commands
special1		  -> special commands #1
special2		  -> special commands #2
special3		  -> special commands #3
all other commands except setadmin/getadmin/deladmin may be executed by all admins

================================================================================
== XMLTEXT =====================================================================
================================================================================

the fmsg* commands allow you to format text in several ways(like in the exe\misctext.dll)
text is enclosed in <TEXT></TEXT> tags while the format can be changed with <TRA .../>
nodes-names must be written in capital chars! 
be sure to replace the following characters within a text-node:
< -> &#60; 
> -> &#62;
& -> &#38;

- <TRA .../> NODE SYNTAX -
the data field of a TRA node consists of an RGB value along with format specifications:
<TRA data="0xBBGGRRFF" mask="-1"/>
BB is the blue value
GG is the green value
RR is the red value
FF is the format value
(all in hexadecimal representation)

format flags are:
bin      hex  dec  effect
00000001 1    1    bold
00000010 2    2    italic
00000100 4    4    underline
00001000 8    8    big
00010000 10   16   big&wide
00100000 20   32   very big
01000000 40   64   smoothest?
10000000 80   128  smoother?
10010000 90   144  small
simply add the flags to combine them (e.g. 7 = bold/italic/underline)

examples:
fmsgu <TRA data="0x1919BD01" mask="-1"/><TEXT>A player has died: Player</TEXT>
this is similar to the standard die-msg(which is shown in bold)
fmsgu <TRA data="0xFF000003" mask="-1"/><TEXT>Hello</TEXT><TRA data="0x00FF0008" mask="-1"/> <TEXT>World</TEXT>
this will show "Hello World" ("Hello" will be blue/bold/italic and "World" green/big)

================================================================================
== EVENTMODE ===================================================================
================================================================================
socket connections may be set to eventmode by entering "eventmode". from then on 
you will receive several event-notifications listed below. once activated, 
eventmode runs until you close the connection.

================================================================================
== KNOWN ISSUES ================================================================
================================================================================
- the sender in the standard chat messages appear a little bit smaller when
  "/set chatfont" is enabled

================================================================================
== SOURCE CODE =================================================================
================================================================================
Since version 1.6.1 plugin we've dropped support for all MSVC versions but VC10.

Note:
flserver uses string-class arguments in some of its functions(f. e. 
PlayerDB::FindAccountFromCharacterName(...)). when you compile since FLHook with 
vc10, which uses a different stl, you can't simply pass strings. that's why
i created the FLHookWString.dll which was compiled with vc6 and just exports
two functions to create/delete flserver compatible strings. If you don't have
vc6 installed then use the FLHookWString.dll from bin and thats it.

If you want the full header files/libs of all of the relevant flserver dlls then 
take a look at FLCoreSDK(www.skif.be). It contains everything you need.

Please note:
I WILL NOT TEACH YOU HOW TO CODE, I WILL NOT TELL YOU HOW TO REVERSE FLSERVER 
AND I WILL NOT REPLY TO "STUPID" QUESTIONS REGARDING THE SOURCE

================================================================================
== BLOWFISH ENCRYPTION PROGRAMMING =============================================
================================================================================
Because Blowfish only supports encrypting 8 bytes of data at once, it is
necessary to pad data (with 0x00s) that is not a multiple of 8 bytes.  When
recieving encrypted data from FLHook, you should check for null characters and
remove them from the decrypted string.  When sending encrypted data to FLHook,
you should pad the string with null characters if necessary.  If the blowfish
implementation you are using specifically encrypts and decrypts strings, this
may already be handled by it.
