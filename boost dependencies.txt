In order to severely reduce the amount of programming required for simple tasks, we have started using the Boost library.
The version compatible with FLHook is the MSVC 14.0 32 BITS. (64 Bits will not work).

The latest version in use is: https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.64.0/boost_1_64_0-msvc-14.1-32.exe/download

In order to streamline the boost dependency in the project management, the arbitrary path for Boost is relative to the solution.

Ex: C:\flhook_2015\dependencies\boost
Or even: D:\kittens\flhook_apples\dependencies\boost

For this purpose it has been excluded from git as it's too heavy. It's up to you to install it properly.
